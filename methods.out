section: Methods
subsection: Simulation system
A system of 12844 molecules (39827 atoms) was simulated.
Virtual sites were used in some of the molecules.

subsection: Simulation settings
A total of 1000 ns were simulated with a time step of 4 fs.
Neighbor searching was performed every 20 steps.
The PME algorithm was used for electrostatic interactions.
with a cut-off of 1.2 nm.
A reciprocal grid of 64 x 64 x 64 cells was used with 4th order B-spline interpolation.
A single cut-off of 1.273 nm was used for Van der Waals interactions.
Pressure coupling was done with the Parrinello-Rahman algorithm.
